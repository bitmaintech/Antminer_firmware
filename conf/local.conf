# Shared-state files from other locations

# Shared state files are prebuilt cache data objects which can 
# used to accelerate build time. This variable can be used to configure the system
# to search other mirror locations for these objects before it builds the data itself.
#
# This can be a filesystem directory, or a remote url such as http or ftp. These
# would contain the sstate-cache results from previous builds (possibly from other 
# machines). This variable works like fetcher MIRRORS/PREMIRRORS and points to the 
# cache locations to check for the shared objects.
